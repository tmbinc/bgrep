bgrep - grep binary signatures

forked from tmbinc/bgrep

I was trying to find specific binary signatures in a program at RUNTIME. But
sadly the original version of bgrep won't do much help so I decided to modify
it.

My bgrep now supports searching both files and processes, using a modified
Sunday algorithm with masked patterns. I also removed some rarely-used pattern
grammar to simplify the code.

Feel free to modify, branch, fork and improve.

usage: bgrep -[pv] [-l count] <hex> <object>
options:
  -p, --process: <object> is pid instead of file path
  -v, --verbose: show both address and binary
  -l, --limit [count]: max number of results to show

The hex string is made up of 0-9, a-f, A-F and wildcard ?. Spaces inserted into
the hex string will be omitted.

an example to find x86 function prefixes in process 9999:

bgrep --process --limit 10 "55 89 e5 ??" 9999
